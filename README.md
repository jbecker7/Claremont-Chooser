# Claremont Chooser Web App

In this project, I am building upon my previous Restaurant Chooser project and creating a Flask app. Using the Pandas library, it handles narrowing the pool of possible restaurants in a much more efficient way. In addition, because it is built in Flask, users can use a dropdown to choose their options before hitting submit.

After building the Flask app, I deployed it using PythonAnywhere. From here, I would like to build a visually-appealing GUI using Javascript and CSS.
