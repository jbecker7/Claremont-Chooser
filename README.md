# Claremont Chooser Web App

In this project, I am building upon my previous Restaurant Chooser project and creating a Flask app. Using the Pandas library, it handles narrowing the pool of possible restaurants in a much more efficient way. In addition, because it is built in Flask, users can use a dropdown to choose their options before hitting submit.

Next, I would like to refine the GUI and put the project online.
